<h3>Some text:</h3>
<p>In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood, burned by the embers of
    Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of hell and tainted beyond ascension. He chose the path of perpetual
    torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plans seeking
    vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the knight sentinels, and those who
    tasted the bite of his sword name him the <span style="color:red">Doomslayer.</span>
</p>
<p>Tempered by the fires of hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the week, for he
    alone was the hell walker, the unchained predator who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and
    ice, in he beginning and the end. And he hunted the slaves of doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the
    divide as none but demon had before.
</p>
<p>And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doom, his prowess was shown. In his crusade the seraphim
    bestowed upon him terrible power and speed and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the blood temples.
    He set fourth without pity upon the beasts of the knight circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the
    Doomslayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.
</p>
<p>The age of his reckoning was uncounted, the scribes carved his name deep into he taverns of hell across eons, with
    each battle etched terror in the hearts of demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to
    feast on the blood of the wicked, for he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew
    swift and unrelenting.
